# List of files with GitHub functionality anywhere in the repo
# that we do not want to ignore

# These files include GitHub settings
!.gitignore

# Keep markdown files used for documentation on GitHub
!README.md
!CONTRIBUTING.md
!LICENSE*

#######################
# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.
